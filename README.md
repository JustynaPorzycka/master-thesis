## Abstract
The thesis aims to define concepts related to algebraic geometry and present them in the context of differential Galois theory. Differential Galois theory, as a generalization of classical Galois theory, serves as a tool for a deeper understanding of the relationships between algebraic and differential structures.

Chapter one introduces the basic concepts from algebraic geometry and the definition of linear algebraic groups, which can be viewed as abstract affine sets. Chapter two is dedicated to differential Galois theory, including the definition of Picard-Vessiot extensions. This theory investigates the structure of automorphism groups of certain differential field extensions. Chapter three discusses practical applications of this theory, illustrating how differential Galois groups can be seen as linear algebraic groups and their connection to the fundamental theorem of differential Galois theory. Additionally, Liouville extensions are defined, and criteria for the solvability of differential Galois groups are examined, which in turn have applications in solving second-order linear differential equations. This chapter demonstrates how theoretical concepts can be applied to practical problems in mathematics and physics.

The text emphasizes the precise definition and discussion of key concepts and highlights the interrelations between various areas of mathematics. The work integrates approaches from several studies referenced in the literature and includes some proofs that were either summarized or omitted in those works.
